# day-50_auto_tinder
Day 50 of 100

Automatic tinder swiper. So it opens the window and auto-logs in (I did phone verification off-screen).

There's a website called thispersondoesnotexist , and basically it's an AI that creates a picture of a random face every time the page is loaded.
So, I used that (fake person image) and I have the bot accept cookies, confirm the location, and disable notifications. Then, it swipes left on everyone. This is to prevent accidental matches and whatnot, while simultaneously testing my code.
